Description: Biips is a general software for Bayesian inference with interacting
    particle systems, a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. It aims at
    popularizing the use of these methods to non-statistician researchers and
    students, thanks to its automated "black box" inference engine. It borrows from
    the BUGS/JAGS software, widely used in Bayesian statistics, the statistical
    modeling with graphical models and the language associated with their
    descriptions.
